## Who Are They?

Metavest is a Toronto based company that leverages Blockchain & Artificial Intelligence to drive down costs and expand revenue generation opportunities through digitization and automation of the entire investment life cycle. They provide a securitization platform that automates the entire investment life cycle covering the issuance of digitial securities, investor on-boarding and fund distribution by levering blockchain and artificical intelligence. 

Metavest caters to various industries by offering the option across private and public blockchains with an interoperable mechanism to ensure that the platform is customized for each organization.

## How it Works

Blockchain allows companies to create digital securities called tokens that are more flexible and nuanced from a financial-engineering perspective. These tokens are embedded with data such as regulatory complaince restrictions, which traditional banking methods would require a significant amount of manual work to validate. As a result of reducing the need for bankers and lawyers to verify and make compliant for trading, the assets and securities are viable for liquidity. 


## Why This Matters

The traditional financianl industry is burnded with high operational costs and a heavy reliance on manual processes which has resulted in inefficiencies. Finanial institutions have been satisfied with their operations up until recent technology innnovation which has been forcefully transforming the way we do business. For these companies to stay relevant and competitive, they must adopt digitial processes into their operations if they want to appeal to the future generations.

With the use of Blockchain, settlements of digital trades can happen within seconds without the need for human intervention. This means that there is significant less risk for human error and there is greater visability into a companies shareholder portfolio. This induces the opportunity to increase the quality of the relationship with the investor.

Blockchain is transforming private equity markets with the ability of speed, integrity, transparency and accessiblity. A shared blockchain could produce a single interface between a PE fund, its investors, and any other permissioned stakeholder.Blockchain can also leverage compliance via smart contracts and rapid settlement of transactions. Regulatory entities can access secure complaince-related data held on the blockchain.

A token, being a digitial representation of an underlying asset exchange over a digital network, has the potential to lead to rapid liquidation. Liquidation within private equity can be a challenging obstacle when there is no systematic way to match buyers with sellers. Developers are working towards a secondary market for trading of these tokenized instruments and once that can be accomplished, liquidation, being an obstacle in PE markets, can be less of a risk to an organization. 


## Why This Maybe Interesting 

If this platform is successfully able to assist stakeholders and investors, across multiple asset classes, this process can will eventually integrate globally and create more opportunity for investment. In this context, blockchains offers the ability of speed, integrity, compliance, and accessability, across the globe.
